        transport vehicles.

        </span>
        <span
          >The OptiLoad application implements multi-criteria analysis methods,
          allowing for the evaluation of package attractiveness based on
          multiple independent criteria and their assigned weight coefficients.
          Based on the resulting objective function value, packages can be
          ranked in terms of their usefulness from the entrepreneur's
          perspective.</span
        >
        <span
          >In the next stage, the application groups packages according to
          delivery distance, enabling the loading sequence to be organized in a
          way that maximizes logistical efficiency â€” packages with more distant
          delivery addresses are placed deeper within the cargo space. The
          subsequent stage involves simulating the placement of packages within
          the vehicle's cargo space, taking into account both geometric
          constraints and the maximum allowable load weight.</span
        >
        <span
          >The software allows users to generate packages, edit cargo space
          parameters, select evaluation criteria, and define the corresponding
          weights and utility function coefficients. The final results of the
          simulation are presented in the form of a 3D visualization,
          facilitating the assessment of both the correctness and effectiveness
          of the proposed loading arrangement.</span

        <span
          >The use of the OptiLoad application enables not only the verification
          of the theoretical assumptions described in the thesis but also the

          operates under conditions close to those found in real-world

          This enables the process to be more tailored and aligned with the
          user's specific needs by assigning relative importance to each
          criterion. However, certain rules must be observed when assigning
          values:
        </span>
        <span
          ><b>- Each criterion must have a value between 0 and 1 </b>- A value
          within this range reflects the relative importance of the criterion,
          with higher values indicating greater significance.
        </span>
        <span
          ><b>- The total sum of assigned values must not exceed 1 </b>- While
          individual criteria can be assigned arbitrary values within the
          allowable range, the cumulative total must remain less than or equal
          to 1.
        </span>
        <span
          ><b>- The sum of defined criteria may be less than 1 </b>- In such
          cases, the remaining unallocated value will be automatically assigned
          to a placeholder category labeled "Other factors" This category
          accounts for potentially relevant factors not explicitly specified by
          the user. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended that users define
          as many relevant criteria as possible to ensure more precise and
